abstract = {Abstract The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is one of two archival resources for experimental data central to biomedical research and education worldwide (the other key Primary Data Archive in biology being the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration). The PDB currently houses >134,000 atomic level biomolecular structures determined by crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and 3D electron microscopy. It was established in 1971 as the first open-access, digital-data resource in biology, and is managed by the Worldwide Protein Data Bank partnership (wwPDB; wwpdb.org). US PDB operations are conducted by the RCSB Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB; RCSB.org; Rutgers University and UC San Diego) and funded by NSF, NIH, and DoE. The RCSB PDB serves as the global Archive Keeper for the wwPDB. During calendar 2016, >591 million structure data files were downloaded from the PDB by Data Consumers working in every sovereign nation recognized by the United Nations. During this same period, the RCSB PDB processed >5300 new atomic level biomolecular structures plus experimental data and metadata coming into the archive from Data Depositors working in the Americas and Oceania. In addition, RCSB PDB served >1 million RCSB.org users worldwide with PDB data integrated with ∼40 external data resources providing rich structural views of fundamental biology, biomedicine, and energy sciences, and >600,000 PDB101.rcsb.org educational website users around the globe. RCSB PDB resources are described in detail together with metrics documenting the impact of access to PDB data on basic and applied research, clinical medicine, education, and the economy.},

  abstract = {The Protein Data Bank currently contains about 600 data sets of three-dimensional protein coordinates determined by X-ray crystallography or NMR. There is considerable redundancy in the data base, as many protein pairs are identical or very similar in sequence. However, statistical analyses of protein sequence-structure relations require nonredundant data. We have developed two algorithms to extract from the data base representative sets of protein chains with maximum coverage and minimum redundancy. The first algorithm focuses on optimizing a particular property of the selected proteins and works by successive selection of proteins from an ordered list and exclusion of all neighbors of each selected protein. The other algorithm aims at maximizing the size of the selected set and works by successive thinning out of clusters of similar proteins. Both algorithms are generally applicable to other data bases in which criteria of similarity can be defined and relate to problems in graph theory. The largest nonredundant set extracted from the current release of the Protein Data Bank has 155 protein chains. In this set, no two proteins have sequence similarity higher than a certain cutoff (30% identical residues for aligned subsequences longer than 80 residues), yet all structurally unique protein families are represented. Periodically updated lists of representative data sets are available by electronic mail from the file server “netserv@embl-heidelberg.de.” The selection may be useful in statistical approaches to protein folding as well as in the analysis and documentation of the known spectrum of three-dimensional protein structures.}

	abstract = {Contrary to popular assumption, the rate of growth of structural data has slowed, and the Protein Data Bank (PDB) has not been growing exponentially since 1995. Reaching such a dramatic conclusion requires careful measurement of growth of novel structures, which can be achieved by clustering entry sequences, or by using a novel index to down-weight entries with a higher number of sequence neighbors. These measures agree, and growth rates are very similar for entire PDB files, clusters, and weighted chains. The overall sizes of Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) categories (number of families, superfamilies, and folds) appear to be directly proportional to the number of deposited PDB files. Using our weighted chain count, which is most correlated to the change in the size of each SCOP category in any time period, shows that the rate of increase of SCOP categories is actually slowing down. This enables the final size of each of these SCOP categories to be predicted without examining or comparing protein structures. In the last 3 years, structures solved by structural genomics (SG) initiatives, especially the United States National Institutes of Health Protein Structure Initiative, have begun to redress the slowing growth of the PDB. Structures solved by SG are 3.8 times less sequence-redundant than typical PDB structures. Since mid-2004, SG programs have contributed half the novel structures measured by weighted chain counts. Our analysis does not rely on visual inspection of coordinate sets: it is done automatically, providing an accurate, up-to-date measure of the growth of novel protein structural data.PDB,Protein Data Bank;SCOP,Structural Classification of Proteins;SG,structural genomics;ID,identity threshold.},

abstract="Intrinsically Unstructured/Disordered Proteins (IUPs/IDPs) exist as highly flexible conformational ensembles without adopting a stable three-dimensional structure. Experimental and bioinformatical studies in the past two decades have shown that these proteins play a central role in various signaling and regulatory processes. Accordingly, their frequency in higher eukaryotes reaches high proportions and their malfunction can be connected to a wide variety of diseases. Recognizing the biological importance of these proteins motivated researchers to understand various aspects of disordered proteins and protein segments from the viewpoint of biochemistry, molecular biology and pharmacology. In general, IDPs are difficult to study experimentally because of the lack of a unique structure in their isolated form. Nevertheless, taking advantage of ongoing efforts in the collection, cataloguing, and annotation of known IDPs in publicly available databases, various bioinformatics tools were developed over the last few years. These methods enable the further identification and characterization of IDPs using only the amino acid sequence. In this chapter---after a brief introduction to IDPs in general---we present a small survey of current methods aimed at identifying disordered proteins or protein segments, focusing on those that are publicly available as web servers. We also discuss in more detail approaches that predict disordered regions and specific regions involved in protein binding by modeling the physical background of protein disorder. Furthermore, we argue that the heterogeneity of disordered segments needs to be taken into account for a better understanding of protein disorder and the correct use and interpretation of the output of disorder prediction algorithms.",
