%\title{Using open data to benchmark internal dynamics of phosphatidylcholine in molecular dynamics simulations}
\title{Using open data to rapidly bench\-mark bio\-molecular simulations: Phospholipid internal dynamics}

\begin{document}



\begin{abstract}
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are a widely used tool to
    study the atomistic structure and dynamics of biomembranes. It
    remains unknown, however, how well the conformational dynamics
    observed in MD simulations correspond to those occurring in real
    life phospholipids. The accuracy of such time scales in MD can be
    assessed by comparing against the effective correlation times of
    the C-H bonds measured in nuclear magnetic resonance experiments
    (J. Chem. Phys. 142 044905 (2015)).

    Here, we analysed the conformational dynamics of phospholipids as
    produced by several commonly used MD models (force fields). None
    of the tested force fields reproduced all the effective
    correlation times within experimental error, much like they do
    not provide accurate conformational ensemble (J. Phys. Chem. B 119 15075 (2015)). However, the
    dynamics observed in CHARMM36 and Slipids were more realistic
    than those seen in the Amber Lipid14, OPLS-based MacRog, and
    GROMOS-based Berger force fields, which were all characterized by
    unrealistically slow dynamics in the glycerol backbone.

\section{Introduction}

Ever since the conception of the Protein Data Bank (PDB)~\cite{nnb1971,wwPDB2018} and the NBCI GenBank, the access to open data has shaped the state of the art of research in life sciences.
Not only has the development of new characterisation techniques (such as molecular replacement~\cite{rossmann62} in macromolecular x-ray crystallography and 3D electron microscopy) been aided by the existence of these databases~\cite{burley2018}, but perhaps more importantly they have lead to entirely new ways of doing science in the form of bio- and cheminformatics, enabling data-driven discovery of drugs~\cite{kirchmair08}, materials~\cite{huang2016} as well as identifying~\cite{hobohm1992,levitt2007} and filling~\cite{meszaros2019} gaps in the databanks themselves. All in all, open access to standardised and searchable pools of experimental data, constantly extending owing to a collaborative effort, has enabled scientific progress that is well beyond the resources of one single research group.

%Today these data banks are regarded irreplaceable core resources. The cost of reproducing all the data in PDB has been estimated to be X and destruction of the databank would lead to a near complete halt both academic and commercial research.

Much of the development of the PDB and other biomolecular databanks into the core resources they are today has been fueled by the push from scientific journals and funders towards public availability and conservation of data. In addition to experimental results, these principles have more recently extended to simulation trajectories of biomolecules, leading to databases of dynamic information. Inspired by the success of bio- and cheminformatics, we seek to exploit this and demonstrate, for the first time, the viability of creating new scientific knowledge analysis of pre-existing, open access simulation data. 

More specifically, we will analyze a wide set of publicly available phosphatidylcholine (PC) phospholipid bilayer molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, produced by using different MD models (force fields). In addition of simulations of one component bilayers under standard conditions, we study trajectories under varying hydration, salt concentration, and cholesterol content. We test whether different force fields reproduce the experimentally observed internal dynamics of PC lipids, and investigate if the dynamics extracted from various models share common features that can be used to draw general conclusions on the system, to suggest future directions for experimental research, and to avoid potential pitfalls in future simulations of bilayers.    

Our choice for the system of interest is inspired by the importance of phospholipids not only as the building blocks of cell membranes but also as emerging candidates for micro- and nanotechnology, such as the use of liposomes as microcapsules in targeted drug delivery~\cite{sercombe15}. These molecules consist of a hydrophilic phosphate head group, which is connected to two hydrophobic fatty acid tails via a glycerol backbone. The ability of lipids to self assemble into bilayer membrane (and other) configurations is a direct consequence of this dual nature. Although biological membranes are complex mixtures of multiple lipid types as well as other molecules, lamellar phospholipid bilayers with one or few lipid types serve as an important model system, that have been successfully used to decipher,  \textit{eg.},  possible molecular mechanisms behind anesthetics~\cite{chau07,XXX}, the effect of cholesterol on membrane structure~\cite{XXX,ferreira13}, and the functioning of membrane proteins~\cite{lindahl08} \todo{add more references}. In particular, MD simulations of these model systems have been widely used~\cite{lyubartsev11,chau07,ferreira13,botan15, ferreira15,miettinen19,XXX} to provide an atomistic view on the biomembranes, and hold vast potential in making further connections between their structure and function.

\begin{comment}
and the conformations adopted by the molecules play a crucial role in determining properties of these lipid assemblies, such as the dipole potential~\cite{Gawrisch92} and the curvature~\cite{XXX}\todo{Markus, any favourite references on curvature?} 

Although biological membranes are complex mixtures of multiple different lipids as well as other molecules, lamellar phospholipid bilayers with one or few lipid types have been successfully used as simplified models systems to decipher,  \textit{eg.},  possible molecular mechanisms behind anesthetics~\cite{chau07,XXX}, the effect of cholesterol on membrane structure~\cite{XXX,ferreira13}, and the functioning of membrane proteins~\cite{lindahl08}. \todo{Markus, do you want to add your favourite topics/references, espc. experimental}. The ability of the simple model membranes to reproduce the biological functioning of headgroup/glycerol structure in cells is backed up by experimental evidence~\cite{gally81}.  In particular, MD simulations of these model systems have been widely used~\cite{lyubartsev11,chau07,ferreira13,botan15, ferreira15,miettinen19,XXX} to provide an atomistic view on the biomembranes, and hold vast potential in making further connections between the structure and the function.

Unfortunately, recent comparison of lipid \mbox{C--H} order parameters from bilayer simulations to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements has shown that none of the currently available lipid MD models perfectly reproduces the conformational ensemble sampled by the headgroup~\cite{botan15}. Here, we take a step further and investigate the dynamics of those MD models. 

\end{comment}

The significance for investigating the conformational dynamics of lipids in bilayer simulations is two-fold. Firstly, when exploring static properties of the bilayers, it is crucial to assess how well the simulations have converged. In order to extract reliable statistics, the conformations sampled have to represent the equilibrium distribution with enough transitions between states. Indeed, simulations of a single (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) DOPC lipid using the CHARMM32b2 force field indicated that the conformations sampled do not replicate the equilibrium distribution even after 500 ns~\cite{vogel12}; also, the C--H bond dynamics of the Berger model was shown~\cite{ferreira15} to be too slow at the glycerol region of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) compared to correlation times extracted from NMR experiments. 

Secondly, for complete picture of membrane functioning, knowledge on the bilayer dynamics in addition to equilibrium measurements are needed. The ability of the MD model to reproduce the relative abundance of different dynamical processes is crucial for the correct interpretation of pathways leading to, e.g., membrane deformation~\cite{chernomordik08} and lipid-induced conformational~\cite{gibson93,phillips09} changes of membrane proteins. The availability of such model could also greatly guide both the configuration and interpretation of NMR experiments used to extract dynamical information from lipid assemblies. 
\todo{the following paragraph could be merged into methods, opinions?
}
Our analysis of the lipid dynamics is based on two quantities, the spin-lattice relaxation rate $R_{1}$ and the effective correlation time $\tau_\mathrm{e}$, both experimentally available through NMR measurements, and directly calculable from all-atom MD simulations.
Out of the two, the $R_{1}$ rates (or the corresponding $T_{1}$ times) have been traditionally used to assess both the conformational dynamics of lipids in experimental bilayers~\cite{feller02,eldho03,wohlert06,klauda08,leftin11} and the dynamics produced by lipid MD models in bilayer simulations\cite{feller02,wohlert06,klauda08,klauda08II}. However, relying on $R_{1}$ only has several drawbacks~\todo{do all flavors (31P,13C,...) have the same problem?}. It builds on an underlying rotation-diffusion model, its sensitivity is typically limited to C--H bond reorientation with time scales $\sim$1-10 ns, and measurements at several temperatures and magnetic field strengths are required to fully characterize the dynamics. To address these deficiencies, two of us introduced a procedure~\cite{ferreira15} for quantifying the effective C--H correlation times ($\tau_\mathrm{e}$)---a model free quantity that encompasses conformational dynamics with time scales up to hundreds of nanoseconds---from bilayer systems. Most importantly, increasing $\tau_\mathrm{e}$ always signals some type of slowdown in the C--H bond dynamics, making the interpretation less ambiguous than for $R_1$, where slowdown in the dynamics can lead to either an increase or a decrease of $R_{1}$ value~\cite{ferreira15}. 

In summary, this work provides first comprehensive comparison of dynamics of different phosphatidylcholine MD models, where both pure bilayers and the model response to changing conditions and composition is explored. The study is conducted using data-driven exploration of pre-existing, publicly available simulation trajectories to demonstrate the power of open, well documented data in creating new knowledge at a lowered computational cost and high potential for automation.  


%we intentionally restrict ourselves to re-use existing, publicly available simulation trajectories. This is to demonstrate the power of open, well documented data in creating new knowledge at a lowered cost. The main source of data was the collection of lipid bilayer simulations originating from the NMRlipids project~\cite{botan15,catte16}

%Both the  have been traditionally assessed based on the spin-lattice relaxation rates $R_{1}$ (or the corresponding $T_{1}$ times), available through NMR measurements. At best, the simulation can be combined with the NMR experiments to provide an interpretation of the molecular motion~\cite{pastor88,klauda08,klauda08II}.  


%Here, we use the effective correlation time to present the first comprehensive comparison of dynamics of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) in different MD models. We not only investigate the pure bilayers in room temperature but also explore the effect of cholesterol content, hydration and monovalent salt to see whether the model dynamics correctly responds to the change in conditions. An MD model fulfilling these requirements can provide a reliable tool to study, e.g., membrane remodeling, or to interpret the experimental spin relaxation rates by connecting them to the underlying dynamical processes.

\section{Methods}
\section{Theoretical Background}\label{sec:theory}
$^{13}$C NMR experiments investigating lipid conformational dynamics take advantage of the fact that the relaxation of $^{13}$C magnetization dominantly happens via the dipolar coupling of the carbon with the magnetic moments of the protons bound to it, with the symmetry axis of the interaction aligning with the C--H bond. The spectral density depicting the $^{13}$C relaxation rates (at frequency $\omega$) is expressed as
\begin{equation}
j{(\omega)}=2\int_{0}^{\infty}\cos(\omega\tau)g(\tau)\mathrm d\tau ,
\end{equation}
which is the Fourier transformation of the C--H bond second order autocorrelation function at time $\tau$
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:BCF}
g(\tau)=\langle P_{2}\left(\vec{\mu}(t)\cdot \vec{\mu}(t+\tau)\right)\rangle ,
\end{equation}
where $\vec{\mu}(t)$ is the unit vector in the direction of the C--H bond at time $t$ and $P_{2}$ is the second order Legendre polynomial. The angular brackets depict averaging over time. The autocorrelation function can be expressed as the product of two functions
\begin{equation}
g(\tau)=g_{\mathrm{f}}(\tau)g_{\mathrm{s}}(\tau) ,
\end{equation} 
where $g_{\mathrm{f}}(\tau)$ characterizes fast decays owing to, for example, the molecular  rotations, and $g_{\mathrm{s}}(\tau)$ describes slow decays that originate from, e.g., the lipid diffusion. The two components, along with the oscillation due to magic angle spinning at the $\sim$kHz region, are depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:schem_teff}. Correlation time of 4.2 ms has been estimated for multilamellar POPC samples at 300 K for the slow modes, whereas  in liquid crystalline lipid bilayers the faster $g_{\mathrm{f}}(\tau)$ decays to a plateau value $S^{2}_{\rm{CH}}$ within a few hundred nanoseconds~\cite{ferreira15}. The C--H bond order parameters
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:OP}
S_{\rm{CH}}=\frac{1}{2}\langle 3\cos^{2}\theta-1\rangle ,
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the angle between the bond and the bilayer normal, are measured in NMR experiments from this plateau. As $S_{\rm{CH}}$ describes the conformational ensemble of the molecule, the fast-decaying component of the rotational correlation function intuitively depicts the time needed to sample these conformations. The characteristic time can be quantified via the effective correlation time
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:teff}
\tau_\mathrm{e}=\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{g_{\mathrm{f}}(\tau)-S^{2}_{\rm{CH}}}{1-S^2_{\mathrm{CH}}}\mathrm d\tau.
\end{equation}
The integrand can be viewed as a reduced and normalized correlation function
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:nBCF}
g'_{\mathrm{f}}(\tau)=\frac{g_{\mathrm{f}}(\tau)-S^{2}_{\rm{CH}}}{1-S^2_{\mathrm{CH}}}.
\end{equation}
That is, $\tau_\mathrm e$ is defined as the area under $g'_{\mathrm{f}}(\tau)$, as
graphically depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:schem_teff}b.
\todo{Maybe also add 1C that explicitly shows $g'_{\mathrm{f}}$?}
It is easily seen that in the presence of more long-lived correlations $\tau_\mathrm{e}$ grows, signaling that more time is needed for full conformational sampling.  

\begin{figure}[t]

\caption{The autocorrelation function $g(\tau)$ a) The fast mode (white background) and the slow mode (shaded green) of the correlation function along with the oscillation owing to magic angle spinning. The fast mode decays to a plateau quantifying the $S_{\mathrm{CH}}$ while the slow mode gives the final descent to zero. b) Illustration of typical C--H bond autocorrelation function obtained from a MD simulation. The gray area under the curve gives a means of quantifying the $\tau_\mathrm{e}$. }
\label{fig:schem_teff}

\end{figure} 


The spin-lattice relaxation rate $R_1$ defines the time-scale on which $^{13}$C longitudal magnetization equilibrates. It is defined as  
\begin{align}
\label{eq:R1}
\begin{split}
R_{1}=&\frac{d^2_{\mathrm{CH}}N_{\mathrm{H}}}{20}\left[j(\omega_{\mathrm{H}}-\omega_{\mathrm{C}})\right. \\
&\left.+3j(\omega_{\mathrm{C}})+6j(\omega_{\mathrm{H}}+\omega_{\mathrm{C}})\right] ,
\end{split}
\end{align}
where $N_{\mathrm{H}}$ is the number of bound hydrogens, $\omega_{\mathrm{H}}$ and $\omega_{\mathrm{C}}$ are the Larmor frequencies for $^{1}$H and $^{13}$C, and $d_{\mathrm{CH}}$ is the rigid dipolar coupling constant. For the methylene bond, $d_{\mathrm{CH}}/2\pi$ approximately equals to -22~kHz.


The dependency of $R_{1}$ on the spectral densities $j$ at the Larmor frequencies means that the $R_{1}$ value depicts the relative amounts of relaxation processes with time-scales near the inverses of the Larmor frequencies. Since the Larmor frequencies depend on the field strength used in the NMR measurements, this typically makes $R_{1}$ sensitive to $\sim$1--10~ns time-scales. Importantly, a change in $R_{1}$ thus indicates a difference in the relative amounts of processes within the detection window, and therefore does not give information on the modulation of the total sampling rate.  


\begin{comment}
 The dipolar coupling constant $d_{\mathrm{CH}}$ is defined as

\begin{equation}
d_{\mathrm{CH}}=\frac{\hslash\gamma_{\mathrm{H}}\gamma_{\mathrm{C}}\mu_{0}}{4\pi\langle r^{3}_{\mathrm{CH}} \rangle} ,
\end{equation}

where $\hslash$ is the reduced Planck constant, $\gamma_{\mathrm{C}}$ and $\gamma_{\mathrm{H}}$ are the gyromagnetic constants for $^{1}H$ and $^{13}C$, $\mu_{0}$ is the vacuum permeability, and $\langle r^{3}_{\mathrm{CH}}\rangle$ denotes the average cubic length of the C-H bond.

The simulational data were analysed using in-house scripts. These are available on GitHub \cite{citehere} along with a Python notebook outlining an example analysis run.
After downloading the necessary files from Zenodo, the trajectory was processed with Gromacs \texttt{gmx trjconv} to make the molecules whole.
The C--H bond order parameters  $S_\mathrm{CH}$, see Eq.~\eqref{eq:OP}, were then calculated with the \texttt{calcOrderParameters.py}\cite{citegithubhere} script that uses the MDanalysis\cite{XXX} Python library.
%
The \mbox{C--H} bond correlation functions
$g(\tau)$, see Eq.~\eqref{eq:BCF},
were calculated with Gromacs5.1.4\cite{XXX} \texttt{gmx rotacf};
note that on simulational (fast) time scales $g = g_\mathrm{s} g_\mathrm{f}= g_\mathrm{f}$.
%
To obtain the $g'_\mathrm f$,
the $S_\mathrm{CH}$ were used to
normalize the $g_\mathrm f$ following Eq.~\eqref{eq:nBCF}.

The effective correlation times $\tau_\mathrm e$ were then calculated by integrating $g'_\mathrm f(\tau)$,
see Eqs.~\eqref{eq:teff} and~\eqref{eq:nBCF},
over time from $\tau=0$ until $\tau = t_0$.
Here
$t_0 = \min
	\{
	t\,|\,g'(t)=0
	\}
$,
that is, $t_\mathrm 0$ is the first time point at which $g'_\mathrm f$ reached zero.
%
If $g'_\mathrm f$ did not reach zero within 
$t_\mathrm{anal}/2$, the 
$\tau_\mathrm e$ was not determined,
but we report only its upper and lower error estimates.

To estimate the error on $\tau_\mathrm e$, we first estimate the error on $g'_\mathrm f(\tau)$.
%
%At a given timepoint $\tau$,
There are two sources of error, $g_{\mathrm{f}}(\tau)$ and $S^2_\mathrm{CH}$.
%
Performing linear error propagation on Eq.~\eqref{eq:nBCF} gives
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
\label{eq:error}
\Delta g'_{\mathrm{f}}(\tau)
%=
%\frac{\mathrm d g'_\mathrm{f}(\tau)}{\mathrm d g_{\mathrm{f}}(\tau)}\Delta g_{\mathrm{f}}(\tau)
%+
%\frac{\mathrm d g'_\mathrm{f}(\tau)}{\mathrm dS_\mathrm{CH}}\Delta S_\mathrm{CH}
=
&\left|
	\frac{1}{1-S^2_\mathrm{CH}}
\right|
\Delta g_{\mathrm{f}}(\tau)\\
&+\\
&\left|
	\frac{2\left(g_\mathrm{f}(\tau)-1\right)S_\mathrm{CH}}{\left(1-S^2_\mathrm{CH}\right)^2}
\right|
\Delta S_\mathrm{CH}.
\end{split}
\end{align}
Here the $\Delta S_\mathrm{CH}$ was determined as in the NMR\-lipids Project:
the standard error of the mean of the $S_\mathrm{CH}$ of all the $N_\mathrm l$ individual lipids~\cite{botan15}.
%
Similarly, we determined the error on $g_{\mathrm{f}}(\tau)$
by first determining an individual correlation function $g^m_{\mathrm{f}}(\tau)$ for each lipid $m$
over the whole trajectory, and then obtaining the error estimate
$\Delta g_{\mathrm{f}}(\tau)$
as the standard error of the mean over the $N_\mathrm l$ lipids.
%
Importantly, this gives an error estimate at each time point $\tau$.

To obtain the lower error estimate on $\tau_\mathrm e$, we integrate the function
$g'_{\mathrm{f}}(\tau) - \Delta g'_{\mathrm{f}}(\tau)$ over time from $\tau=0$ until $\tau=t_\mathrm l$.
Here
\begin{equation}
t_\mathrm l= \min
\left\{
	\left\{
		t\,|\,g'_{\mathrm{f}}(t) - \Delta g'_{\mathrm{f}}(t) = 0
	\right\},
	\frac{t_\mathrm{anal}}{2}
\right\}.
\end{equation}
That is,
$t_\mathrm l$ is
the first time point at which the lower error estimate of $g'_\mathrm f$ reached zero;
or $t_\mathrm l=t_\mathrm{anal}/2$, if zero was not reached by that point.
%This is the one sigma error.

To obtain the upper error estimate on $\tau_\mathrm e$, we first integrate the function
$g'_{\mathrm{f}}(\tau) + \Delta g'_{\mathrm{f}}(\tau)$ over time from $\tau=0$ until
$
t_\mathrm u= \min
\left\{
	t_0,
	{t_\mathrm{anal}}/{2}
\right\}.
$
Note, however,
that this is not yet sufficient, because there could be slow processes that our simulation was not
able to see. Although these would contribute to $\tau_\mathrm e$ with a low weight,
their contribution over long times could still add up to a sizable effect on $\tau_\mathrm e$.
%
That said, it seems feasible to assume (see Fig. \ref{fig:schem_teff}A) that there are no longer-time contributions
to $g_\mathrm f$ than something that decays with a time constant of $10^{-6}$~s.
%
We use this as our worst case estimate to assess the upper error on $\tau_\mathrm e$, and
%
assume that all the decay from the time point
$
t_\mathrm u= \min
\left\{
	t_0,
	{t_\mathrm{anal}}/{2}
\right\}
$
onwards comes solely from this slowest process.
%
The additional contribution to the upper error for $\tau_\mathrm e$ then reads
$
\Delta g'_\mathrm f(t_\mathrm u) \times \left(\exp(-t_\mathrm u / 10^{-6}\,\mathrm s) - \exp(-1)\right) \times 10^{-6}\,\mathrm s.
$
\todo{Discuss the possibility of skewed error distributions?}

%The effective correlation times $\tau_\mathrm e$ were calculated by integrating, see Eq.~\eqref{eq:teff}, $g'_\mathrm f(\tau)$ over time from $\tau=0$ until $\tau = t_0$.

The $R_{1}$ rates were calculated using Eq.~\eqref{eq:R1},
%
with the spectral density $j(\omega)$ obtained for
a given normalized correlation function $g'_\mathrm f$
by fitting it with a sum of $N=71$ exponentials
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:weights}
g'_\mathrm{f}(\tau)\approx\sum_{i=1}^{N}\alpha_{i}e^{-\tau/\tau_{i}},
\end{equation}
with logarithmically spaced time-scales $\tau_{i}$ ranging from 0.1~ps to 1~$\mu$s, 
and then calculating the spectral density of this fit
based on the Fourier transformation\cite{ferreira15}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:j}
j{(\omega)}=2(1-S_\mathrm{CH})\sum_{i=1}^{N}\alpha_{i}\frac{\tau_{i}}{1+\omega\tau_{i}} .
\end{equation}
%
The $R_{1}$ rate of a given C--H bond was
first calculated separately for each lipid $m$ (using Eq.~\eqref{eq:R1} with $N_\mathrm{H}=1$, and $j^m(\omega)$ obtained for the normalized correlation function ${g'_\mathrm f}^m$). The thus obtained $N_\mathrm{l}$ measurements per bond were then assumed independent:
Their mean gave the $R_1$ rate of the bond, and 
standard error of the mean its uncertainty.
%
The total $R_1$ rate of a given carbon was obtained as a sum of the $R_1$ rates of its C--H bonds.
%
When several carbons were known to have contributed to the experimental $R_1$ rate of a carbon segment, the carbon-wise $R_1$ rates were averaged to obtain the segment-wise $R_1$ rate.
%
The segment-wise error estimates were obtained by standard error propagation, starting from the uncertainties of the $R_1$ rates of the C--H bonds.

To gain some qualitative insight on the time scales at which the main contributions to the (headgroup) $R_1$ rates arise,
we also looked at 'cumulative' $R_1$ rates, $R_1(\tau)$. These
contained just those contributions in the sum of Eq.~\eqref{eq:j} for which $\tau_i<\tau$.
Note that here the $g'_\mathrm{f}$ averaged over lipids was used;
therefore, the 'cumulative' $R_1(\tau\to\infty)$ does not necessarily have exactly
the same numerical value as the actual $R_1$.

Finally, we note that the fit of Eq.~\eqref{eq:weights} provides an alternative
to estimating $\tau_\mathrm{e}$, because
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:TeffSum}
\tau_\mathrm{e}
	=\int_0^\infty\!g'_\mathrm f(\tau)\,\mathrm d\tau
	\approx\sum_{i=1}^{N}\alpha_{i}\tau_{i}.
\end{equation}
When the simulation trajectory is not long enough for the correlation function to reach the plateau, integrating $g'_\mathrm f$ gives a lower bound estimate for $\tau_\mathrm{e}$, while the sum of Eq.~\eqref{eq:TeffSum} includes also (some) contribution from the longer-time components via the fitting process.
However, in practice the fit is often highly unreliable in terms of depicting the long tails of the correlation function, and thus in this work we chose to quantify $\tau_\mathrm{e}$ using the area under $g'_\mathrm f$, and estimate its errors as discussed in detail above.



\section{Results and Discussion}

In the following, we discuss phospholipid internal dynamics in
six different MD force fields, %Berger, Slipids, MacRog, Lipid14, ECC, and CHARMM36
first at standard conditions (pure POPC bilayers, full hydration, no salt;
see Table~\ref{tab:standr} for simulation details and Fig~\ref{fig:teff_R1} for results).
%
%An assessment of the bilayer dynamics under one set of conditions does not a give complete picture of the membrane functioning.
We then proceed to
cover a wider range of experimentally, biologically, and computationally relevant conditions, and investigate how the dynamics change when cholesterol is added to the bilayer (Table~\ref{tab:chol} and Fig.~\ref{fig:chol}), when hydration level is reduced (Table~\ref{tab:hydr} and Fig.~\ref{fig:hydration}), and when monovalent salt is added to the solution (Table~\ref{tab:salt} and Fig.~\ref{fig:salt}).

One should keep in mind that none of the force fields we study
produces all the C--H bond order parameters, $S_\mathrm{CH}$, within experimental accuracy~\cite{botan15}.
%
%(In CHARMM36 the three headgroup segments have rather good $S_\mathrm{CH}$: $\gamma$ within $\pm0.01$, $\beta$ within $\pm0.04$, and $\alpha$ within $\pm0.02$.)
%
In other words, the structural ensembles simulated do not exactly match
the structural ensemble occurring in reality, that is, these simulations are not a true computational microscope.
%
Consequently, the
$\tau_\mathrm{e}$ times and $R_1$ rates
depict the dynamics of sampling a somewhat different phase space
for each model. %that differs from what is being observed in the experiments.
%
To this end,
we will try to avoid overly detailed discussion on the models and rather concentrate on detecting common and qualitative trends.


\subsection*{Effective correlation times $\tau_\mathrm e$ at standard conditions.}
The left panels of Fig.~\ref{fig:teff_R1} compare the $\tau_\mathrm{e}$ obtained for fully hydrated POPC bilayers in experiments (black) and in the six different MD force fields (color).

Qualitatively, every force field captures the general shape of the $\tau_\mathrm{e}$ profile: Dynamics slows down towards the glycerol backbone in both the headgroup and in the tails. Quantitatively, MD has a tendency towards
slightly too fast dynamics in the membrane core,
but
at the water-facing interface MD is typically clearly too slow.
CHARMM36 and Slipids show the best overall performance---although the $\tau_\mathrm{e}$ in Slipids exhibit a qualitatively wrong, decreasing, trend from $\mathrm g_{3}$ to $\mathrm g_{1}$.

The slowness of MD around the glycerol backbone is consistent with previous results for the Berger model~\cite{ferreira15}. It also agrees with the insufficient conformational sampling of glycerol backbone torsions observed in 500-ns-long CHARMMc32b2~\cite{schlenkrich96,feller00} simulations of a DOPC lipid~\cite{vogel12}. % The first carbon of the palmitoyl tail is the only location where some force fields have a tendency to underestimate $\tau_{\mathrm{eff}}$. 

%We emphasize that the simulation data in Fig.~\ref{fig:teff_R1} give a \emph{lower} limit of $\tau_\mathrm{e}$, as discussed in Theoretical Background (Sec.~\ref{sec:theory}). The $\tau_\mathrm{e}$ values could increase further if the trajectories were extended, and thus the true overestimation could be more severe than what was seen here.

It is worth noting that although temperature varied across these openly available simulation data, it was in no case lower than in the experiment. %As one would expect $\tau_\mathrm{e}$ to decrease with increasing temperature, the slow dynamics observed in some force fields do not occur because of the temperature difference.
As decreasing the temperature would increase the
$\tau_\mathrm{e}$---as indicated by the CHARMM36 simulations at different temperatures---any
overestimation of $\tau_\mathrm{e}$ by MD would get worse, were the simulations done at the experimental 298\,K.

\subsection*{$R_1$ rates at standard conditions.}
The panels on the right side of Fig.~\ref{fig:teff_R1} compare experimental and simulated $R_{1}$ rates under the same conditions as for the $\tau_\mathrm{e}$ on the left.

The $R_1$ comparison distinctly differs from what is seen for $\tau_\mathrm{e}$.
Some models that do very well for $\tau_\mathrm{e}$, do rather poorly for $R_1$, such as CHARMM36 in the $\gamma$, $\beta$, and $\alpha$ segments.
Also examples to the contrary are seen: MacRog gives particularly fitting $R_{1}$ rates for the $\beta$, $\alpha$, g$_3$, and g$_1$ segments, although it systematically overestimates their $\tau_\mathrm{e}$.

To appreciate the implications of such differences, let us recall that
matching our experimental $R_1$ rates (measured at 125\,MHz)
is a necessary condition for a given force field to have correct rotational dynamics at the $(2\pi\times125~\mathrm{MHz})^{-1}\approx1$\,ns time scale.
In contrast, $\tau_\mathrm{e}$ reflects all the sub-$\mu$s time scales (Fig.~\ref{fig:schem_teff}).

Figure~\ref{fig:teff_R1} reveals a few cases where both $R_1$ and $\tau_\mathrm{e}$ (almost) match experiments, suggesting (almost) correct rotational dynamics at all relevant time scales.
%
%, and for the .
%
For example, 
%LET'S MENTION ONLY THE VERY GOOD ONES
Slipids does a good job for the $\beta$ and $\alpha$ segments;
CHARMM36 for the g$_3$, g$_2$,  C2 and C3;
Lipid14 and ECC for the oleoyl double bond; and
MacRog for the tail end segments.
%
(Notably,
all force fields are qualitatively correct in giving that $\mathrm g_2$ has the smallest $R_1$ of the glycerol segments and segment 9 of the oleoyl double bond segments. That said, no MD model captures that the $R_1$ rates for the oleoyl segments 8, 10, and 11 are all roughly equal.)

In Fig.~\ref{fig:teff_R1} there are also cases where a matching $R_1$ is accompanied by a larger-than-experimental $\tau_\mathrm{e}$. Such a combination suggests that MD does well at the 1\,ns scale, but has too slow long-time dynamics.
%
The most prominent example of this is MacRog for $\beta$, $\alpha$, and the glycerol region.

Figure~\ref{fig:teff_R1} also has cases where $\tau_\mathrm{e}$ matches experiments, but $R_1$ does not. This indicates a cancelation of errors for the $\tau_\mathrm{e}$: The wrong dynamics at the 1\,ns scale are compensated by wrong dynamics at other time scales.
%
This is seen to be the case in all five all-atom force fields for the $\gamma$ segment,
%for Slipids around the double bond,
and for CHARMM36 in $\beta$ and $\alpha$.
%
As CHARMM36 on the whole did rather well for both $R_1$ and $\tau_\mathrm{e}$,
let us next study this shortcoming on the headgroup $R_1$ rates
in some more detail.
%
%Berger and Slipids for tail segment 2.

%In the tail region, the MD models are in somewhat worse agreement with $R_{1}$ rates than what was seen for $\tau_\mathrm{e}$.
%General tendency for MD to succeed in shorter time scales whereas rotations with slower dynamics are not depicted as well?

\subsection*{Dynamics of headgroup segments in CHARMM36.}

Figure~\ref{fig:cumulativeR1s}A zooms in on the headgroup ($\gamma$, $\beta$, $\alpha$) segments,
whose $\tau_\mathrm e$ were not clearly visible on the scale of Fig.~\ref{fig:teff_R1}.
%
For all three segments, CHARMM36 matches the experimental $\tau_\mathrm e$,
but overestimates $R_1$.
%
No other force field does any better for $\gamma$, but
for the $\beta$ and $\alpha$ segments Slipids provides almost perfect dynamics.

\begin{figure}[!h]

\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Figs/R1_and_comp.pdf}
\caption{

}
\label{fig:cumulativeR1s}
\end{figure}

The time scales that most contribute to $R_1$ rates are highlighted by the
'cumulative' $R_1(\tau)$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:cumulativeR1s}B).
It is obtained, as detailed in Methods,
by including in the sum of Eq.~\eqref{eq:j} only terms with $\tau_i<\tau$.
Consequently, at $\tau\to\infty$ the 'cumulative' $R_1(\tau)$ approaches the actual $R_1$.

Figure~\ref{fig:cumulativeR1s}B shows
that for models that overestimate the $R_1$ rate of $\gamma$
(MacRog, CHARMM36, and Slipids, see Fig.~\ref{fig:cumulativeR1s}A)
the major contribution to $R_1$ arises at $\tau>50$\,ps.
In contrast, for those that underestimate the $R_1$ rate
(Lipid14 and ECC, see Fig.~\ref{fig:teff_R1})
the major contribution arises at $\tau<50$\,ps.
%
This also manifests in the
distribution of fitting weights ($\alpha_i$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:weights}) in Fig.~\ref{fig:cumulativeR1s}C:
The earlier the non-zero weights occur, the smaller is the resulting $R_1$.

For the $\beta$ and $\alpha$ segments, Fig.~\ref{fig:cumulativeR1s}B shows
that the main contribution to $R_1$ rates arises
between 200~ps and 2~ns.
%
As CHARMM36 has the largest weights of all models in this window (Fig.~\ref{fig:cumulativeR1s}C),
it overestimates $R_1$.
%
%For example
Slipids, which has simultaneously $R_1$ and $\tau_\mathrm e$ correct,
has its largest weights at $\tau<200$\,ps.
%
Indeed, considerable weights
at short time scales ($<10$\,ps in $\alpha$ for Lipid14, ECC, Berger) and
at long time scales ($>10$\,ns in both $\beta$ and $\alpha$ for MacRog and Berger)
do not manifest at all in the $R_1$ rates.
%
However, the latter contribute heavily on $\tau_\mathrm e$,
which is thus considerably overestimated by MacRog and Berger (Fig.~\ref{fig:teff_R1}).

What are the motions in the 0.2--2\,ns window that are over-presented in CHARMM36?
Identifying them and speeding them up would improve the model dynamics.
However, the connection between the fitted correlation times and the correlation times of distinct motional processes such as dihedral rotations and lipid wobbling turns out to be highly non-trivial; we thus refrain from further analysis here.

\subsection*{Effect of cholesterol.}
The experimental effective correlation times $\tau_\mathrm e$
(Fig.~\ref{fig:chol}A, top panels)
show that when cholesterol is added,
the glycerol region conformational dynamics
slow down markedly.
%
The tail segments slow down too,
the effect increasing towards the backbone.
In stark contrast, however,
the $\tau_\mathrm e$ of headgroup segments ($\gamma$, $\beta$, $\alpha$)
appear fully unaffected by cholesterol.
%
Furthermore, cholesterol induces no measurable change in the
headgroup $\beta$ and $\alpha$ segment
dynamics at short ($\sim$1\,ns) time scales, as
demonstrated by
the experimental $R_{1}$ rates (Fig.~\ref{fig:chol}A, lower panels).
That said,
there is a measurable change to $R_1$ at $\gamma$,
at the oleoyl double bond, and at the tail end.

All the force fields investigated qualitatively reproduce slow downs of $\tau_\mathrm e$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:chol}B):
Slipids gives the best magnitude estimates, while CHARMM36 and MacRog clearly overestimate the changes at the glycerol, C2, and C3 carbons. Notably, MacRog {\color{red} (and Berger?)} predicts an erroneous slow down also for the $\beta$ and $\alpha$ carbons, for which experiments detect no change.
%
Also,  while CHARMM36 correctly shows no chance in $\tau_\mathrm{e}$
of the $\gamma$, $\beta$, and $\alpha$ carbons,
it does predict a clearly non-zero $\Delta R_{1}$ for all three, indicative of some inaccuracies in the
headgroup rotational dynamics. % at shorter time-scales.
Such inaccuracies might affect the recent findings~\cite{leeb18}
obtained using CHARMM36
that 
(at least at small cholesterol concentrations)
the headgroups of PCs neighbouring a cholesterol (within 6.6\,\AA) spend more time on top of the cholesterol than elsewhere;
such arrested rotations should manifest on $\tau_\mathrm e$ and $R_1$.
%
Interestingly, 
the tail $\Delta R_{1}$ seem to be pretty well captured by
all three all-atom force fields, whereas Berger fails to capture the change at the oleoyl bond.

%Along with the slow-down of dynamics, all the models show an increase in the $\vert S_{\rm{CH}}\vert$ upon addition of cholesterol at the tail region (\todo{Show data?}), reflecting the reduced available volume for the POPC.\todo{Is this a known effect/explanation?}

%The change observed here, however, is particularly sensitive to the length of the trajectory as cholesterol-induced increase in effective correlation time is likely to lead to worse convergence of the correlation function within the limited simulation time, and more drastic underestimation of $\tau_\mathrm{e}$ is expected than for simulations without cholesterol. This will, consequently, cause a tendency towards underestimation on the strength of the cholesterol-driven modulation of the effective correlation time.

\subsection*{Effect of drying.}
Figure~\ref{fig:hydration}A shows how a mild dehydration affects
C--H bond dynamics in the PC headgroup and glycerol backbone;
the plot compares the experimental effective correlation times $\tau_\mathrm e$
measured for POPC at full hydration and for DMPC (1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine)
at 13 waters per lipid.
The $\tau_\mathrm e$ are the same within experimental accuracy.
%
This is in line with what was seen experimentally when adding cholesterol
(Fig.~\ref{fig:chol}): The headgroup ($\gamma$, $\beta$, $\alpha$)
$\tau_\mathrm e$ are unaffected by structural differences
(such as the presence of cholesterol or the tail types)
in the glycerol and tail regions.
In addition,
Fig.~\ref{fig:hydration}A indicates that
a mild dehydration does not alter the $\tau_\mathrm e$
in the headgroup and glycerol regions.

Figure~\ref{fig:hydration}B shows the effects of dehydration in three MD models.
Combination of
the unrealistically slow dynamics especially in the glycerol backbone (Fig.~\ref{fig:teff_R1}) and
the relatively short lengths of the openly available trajectories %with dehydration conditions
(Table~\ref{tab:hydr})
led to large uncertainty estimates. %for simulation data are large. %which makes discussion challenging.
%
However, in the $\gamma$ segment
there is clearly no effect above 13\,w/l in CHARMM36 and MacRog,
in agreement with the experiments;
lower water contents show a slow down, 
especially in MacRog below 10\,w/l. 
%
Similarly, the
$\beta$ and $\alpha$ segments
show no detectable change above 13\,w/l
for CHARMM36 and Berger,
in agreement with the experiments;
below 10 w/l Berger shows a slowdown, and
in CHARMM36 the slowdown manifests as an abrupt increase of the uncertainty estimate.
%
For the glycerol segments,
due to the large uncertainties,
only qualitative trends of the lower error estimate can be looked at:
For CHARMM36 the lower error estimate stays almost constant all the way until 7\,w/l,
for Berger and MacRog it suggests a slowdown starting already from $\sim$20\,w/l.

These simulational findings indicate that
experiments at hydration levels below 10\,w/l would also show an increase in $\tau_\mathrm e$.
This prediction is in line with the
exponential slow-down
%(decay constant $\sim$4 removed waters per lipid)
of the headgroup conformational dynamics
upon dehydration that was indicated by $^2$H-NMR $R_{1}$ measurements
of DOPC bilayers:
$R_1\sim\exp(-n_{{\mathrm w\!}_{/\mathrm l}}/4)$~\cite{ulrich94}.
%
The slowdown was attributed to the reduction in the effective volume available for the headgroup~\cite{ulrich94}
owing to its tilt towards the membrane upon dehydration;
the tilt is observed via changes of the lipid headgroup order parameters~\cite{bechinger91},
and is qualitatively reproduced by all the simulation models~\cite{botan15}.

%
An increasing trend with decreasing hydration is observed for all the segments,
indicating changes of headgroup dynamics at short ($\sim$1\,ns) time scales.
Interestingly, only CHARMM36 captures this,
whereas Berger and MacRog present the opposite, decreasing, trend for the $\beta$ and $\alpha$ segments.

The here discussed slow down should be of significance
not only when simulating a bilayer (stack) under low hydration,
but also for studies of inter\-membrane interactions, such as membrane fusion, because these naturally lead to dehydrated conditions when the lipid assemblies approach. Slower dynamics imply that longer simulation times are needed for equilibration, for reliably quantifying the properties of the bilayers, and for observing rare events. %such as the lipid tail flips from one membrane to another in case of the fusion~\cite{best citation here}. Same applies in simulations performed in increasing concentrations of cholesterol, as the slow down of dynamics and the increase of tail order parameters observed therein are analogous to those occurring upon dehydration. \todo{really not the smoothest text}

\subsection*{Effect of cation binding.}
\todo{MARKUS: I have started to think that we maybe should drop this section, because we do not have any experimental data to compare against. However, if we do decide to keep it, to me it seems that our main point here is not on the effects monovalent salt, but rather on the effects of cation binding. Therefore, it would be better to plot $\Delta\tau_\mathrm e$ as a function of the bound cation charge, as we did in Fig.~3 of Ref.~\citenum{catte16}; then we could also include calcium data.}

Finally, let us comment on the response of the MD model dynamics to increasing amounts of monovalent salt.
To our knowledge, no experimental $^{13}$C-NMR $R_1$ or $\tau_\mathrm e$ data exists as a function of monovalent salt concentration; therefore, the following discussion is rather qualitative.
Experimentally, the modulation of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carbon order parameters upon increasing ion concentration have been used to quantify ion binding to lipid bilayers (the molecular electrometer~\cite{seeling87,catte16}). The order parameters are constant for POPC bilayers under NaCl addition in experiments, indicating negligible ion binding. Based on this, we anticipate the effective correlation times also to be unaffected by monovalent salt, however, to our knowledge no experimental measurements have been conducted to quantify this.

The molecular electrometer has been used to show that most molecular dynamics force fields overestimate the binding of monovalent ions to PC bilayers~\cite{catte16}: In the simulations the modulation of the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carbon order parameters by increasing NaCl concentration was overestimated compared to the experiments, and accompanied by accumulation of ions at the bilayer surface. In Fig.~\ref{fig:salt} we compare three force fields, one that is known to exhibit pronounced overbinding~\cite{catte16} (MacRog) and two producing more realistic binding affinity (Slipids and CHARMM36). The lateral distribution of Na$^{+}$ ions near the bilayer is quantified in Fig.~\ref{fig:salt}A whereas Fig.~\ref{fig:salt}B shows the chance in $\tau_{\rm{e}}$ for increasing salt concentration. Ion accumulation results in a slow down in the effective correlation time. %that is somewhat proportional to the strength of ion binding.
Correlation times extracted from CHARMM36 vary only a little (low ion binding) when ion concentration is increased, whereas a slightly more pronounced change is observed with Slipids, and MacRog exhibits a clear slow-down (significant ion binding). This indicates that, similarly to the order parameters, $\tau_{\rm{e}}$ may be useful in investigating the ion binding affinity of lipid bilayers and experimental work exploring this avenue would be interesting.

\section{Conclusions}


---

Q: How is the effective correlation time $\tau_\mathrm e$ related to the autocorrelation of the order parameter $S_\mathrm{CH}$?
After all, $\tau_\mathrm e$ does measure the reorientation of the C--H bond, which is clearly related to how fast the $S_\mathrm{CH}$ is sampled.

A: In a lipid bilayer, the second order rotational correlation function approaches $S^2_\mathrm{CH}$. The speed of this approach tells how fast the C--H bond orientations are sampled. In the relaxation experiment this speed is measured.

In the C--H bond order parameter experiment one measures how much of the second order rotational correlation is left after all the available C--H bond orientations in the bilayer have been sampled.

That is,  $\tau_\mathrm e$ does indeed measure how fast the $S^2_\mathrm{CH}$ is sampled.

If the relaxation is single-exponential, $\tau_\mathrm e$ is the relaxation time of this exponential process. If the relaxation is multi-exponential, $\tau_\mathrm e$ is the weighted mean of the corresponding set of relaxation times.

In the multi-exponential case it is a bit hard to say just based on $\tau_\mathrm e$, how long one needs to sample the $S_\mathrm{CH}$, because this depends also on the above-mentioned weights of the processes.

The main advantage of $\tau_\mathrm e$ is that the larger (smaller) it is, the slower (faster) the process is. The same is not true for $R_1$ or other spin relaxation parameters, because their connection to the molecular dynamics is complicated, and goes through the spectral density, see Eq.~\eqref{eq:R1}.

Here, we have investigated the dynamics of phosphatidylcholine molecular dynamics models using publicly available MD trajectories. The MD models are able to qualitatively capture the correlation time profile of POPC---the slow glycerol backbone and the faster dynamics of the headgroup and tail regions---but most are prone to too slow dynamics of the glycerol C--H bonds.  In general, the these force fields reproduce the experimentally detected $R_{1}$ values adequately, indicating that processes at time scales $\sim$1 ns are represented but problems arise at longer time-scales. While none of the force fields is able to reproduce all the experimental values, the CHARMM36 POPC model performs well when compared to the effective correlation times, while the Slipids and Lipid14 force field provide realistic $R_{1}$ in the PC headgroup and glycerol regions. However, since none of the current MD models reproduce the experimental order parameters, these timescales depict a sampling of a conformational space that does not fully represent the underlying reality.


In addition to the bilayers under standard conditions, we also explored how the dynamics react to the addition of cholesterol, salt, and to the reduction of hydration level. When cholesterol is mixed into the POPC bilayer, the conformational dynamics of the tails and the glycerol regions slows down. Again, the MD models are able to qualitatively capture this, but some also predict an increase in the correlation times for the headgroup carbons, possibly leading to erroneous conclusions. In increasing salt concentration a behaviour reminiscent of the molecular electrometer was observed: Amount of ion binding to the bilayer correlated with the magnitude of slowdown in the correlation times. This could open up the possibility of using effective correlation times in quantifying the ion binding to lipid bilayers. When reducing the water content, the MD models exhibited somewhat constant correlation times down to $\sim$15 waters per lipid in agreement with experimental data. After this, a slow down was observed.\todo{hydration needs some kind of statement of significance.}

By gathering a set of experimental information on the phosphatidylcholine dynamics and underlining some of the typical features of the MD models, this study sets a foundation and a potential roadmap for further improvement of the current force fields. While work is still needed in capturing even the correct order parameters, the dynamics is equally essential part of developing MD into a true computational microscope; after all, it is possible to obtain the correct order parameters just by freezing the system into a set of selected conformations.\todo{not very smoothly put, help!}  

Finally, this work demonstrates the power of open data in creating new knowledge out of existing trajectories at a reduced computational and labor cost. Although no new simulations were performed for the purpose of this work, we were able to conduct a comprehensive study on the dynamics of MD models under several conditions. An interesting extension would be exploring other lipid headgroups individually as well as performing a comparison of MD model dynamics between headgroup types, as the available simulation data goes well beyond simulations of lipids with the phosphocholine headgroup. If the data are well indexed and documented, this process could be easily automated and has the potential to facilitate faster progress, eg., in the development of lipid (and other) MD models. Naturally, such database would provide a fruitful platform to other machine learning applications as well.
